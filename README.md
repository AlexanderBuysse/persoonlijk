# persoonlijk

This is a school project where the goal was to make a personal message and share it with a person.
This project is made in Next.js and we had to use some specific features of Next.js. We had to use different services or technologies and combine these in some way.
It was also required that we used new technologies we hadden't seen in our lessons.

I used different api's and geolocation.
